Introduce yourself in this file!

Tell us your name, year, school, major (if you are undecided, write down the frontrunners), and a fun fact!

I am Mutian Shen. I am a sophomore in LSA majoring in mathematics and possibly doublt majoring in CS. For the fun fact, I love listening to podcasts that cover history, economics, and politics.
